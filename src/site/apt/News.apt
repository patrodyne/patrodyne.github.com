	New project is in the works to use our Java Scripting Engine as a shebang.
	In Linux and Unix, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of
	the characters "number sign" and "exclamation mark" (that is, "#!").

	When it occurs as the initial two characters on the first line of a shell
	script, the rest of the script is executed by the interpreter specified on
	that line. The JavaBang project will allow Java to be used as shell scripts!

	Scripting for Java is a JSR-223 implementation of a ScriptEngine to execute
	Java statements from within an application like TransformIO. The project
	produces a JAR that can be used as a embedded library or as an executable
	to run source code dynamically.

	CLI.

	<TransformIO>, or TIO for short, is a new project <in development>. When TIO is
	released it will be an extract, transform and load tool with three modes of
	execution:
	
	[[1]] Desktop Graphic User Interface (GUI).

	[[2]] Terminal Text User Interface (TUI).

	[[3]] Command Line Interface (CLI).

	[]

	TIO uses a batch file, expressed in XML, to configure:
	
	[[1]] The record format of the source stream (extract).

	[[2]] An optional transformation using your choice of scripting language:
	
		[[a]] Bean Shell
		
		[[b]] Groovy

		[[c]] Java
		
		[[d]] JavaScript
		
		[[e]] Jython
		
		[[f]] Other JSR 223 compliant scripting engines.

	[[3]] The record format of the target stream (load).

	<<On the surface>>, our {{{../sites/site-hello/index.html}Site Hello}} project
	is trivial. It builds an application to display a simple salutation. As such,
	the application can be used as a starting point for any Swing project. It uses
	one class to launch the application and another to start the GUI. The launcher
	limits its imports to the standard classloader but the GUI or other classes
	may use packages loaded by the Java Extension Mechanism. In the event that the
	extension path is not present, the launcher catches the exception and informs
	the user with a pop-up dialog.
	
	<<Under the surface>>, our {{{../sites/site-hello/index.html}Site Hello}}
	project is actually about using a terrific open source tool from
	{{{http://izpack.org/}IzPack}} to create an installer for any project. Learn
	how to add a user-friendly installer to your project. Our thanks to the
	developers at {{{http://izpack.org/}IzPack}} and See our demonstration page
	for {{{../sites/site-hello/Demonstration.html}more}}.

	Patrodyne Site Skin is a custom skin for the 
	{{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin}Maven Site Plugin}}. If
	you use Maven to build your project then, perhaps, you are using the site 
	plugin to generate a project web site. If not, but you would like to build a
	web site to describe your project, review the <Maven Site Plugin> and come
	back to learn what our custom skin can do for you!
