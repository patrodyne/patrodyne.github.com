	<TransformIO>, or TIO for short, is a new project <in development>. When TIO is
	released it will be an extract, transform and load tool with three modes of
	execution:
	
	[[1]] Desktop Graphic User Interface (GUI).

	[[2]] Terminal Text User Interface (TUI).

	[[3]] Command Line Interface (CLI).

	TIO uses a batch file, expressed in XML, to configure:
	
	[[1]] The record format of the source stream (extract).

		[[a]] Bean Shell
		
		[[b]] Groovy

		[[c]] Java

	<<On the surface>>, our {{{../sites/site-hello/index.html}Site Hello}} project
	is trivial. It builds an application to display a simple salutation. As such,
	the application can be used as a starting point for any Swing project. It uses
	one class to launch the application and another to start the GUI. The launcher
	limits its imports to the standard classloader but the GUI or other classes
	may use packages loaded by the Java Extension Mechanism. In the event that the
	extension path is not present, the launcher catches the exception and informs
	the user with a pop-up dialog.
	
	<<Under the surface>>, our {{{../sites/site-hello/index.html}Site Hello}}
	project is actually about using a terrific open source tool from
	{{{http://izpack.org/}IzPack}} to create an installer for any project. Learn
	how to add a user-friendly installer to your project. Our thanks to the
	developers at {{{http://izpack.org/}IzPack}} and See our demonstration page
	for {{{../sites/site-hello/Demonstration.html}more}}.
